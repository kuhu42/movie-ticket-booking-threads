# Movie Ticket Booking using pthreads
The objective of this code is to simulate a ticket booking system for three different movies
(movie 1, movie 2, and movie 3) with the following goals:
• **Multithreaded Ticket Booking System:** Allow multiple customers to interact with the system
concurrently, each selecting a movie and specifying the number of tickets they wish to
purchase.
• **Mutex for Synchronisation:** Ensure that access to the ticket counters is synchronised using a
mutex, preventing data races and inconsistencies when customers attempt to purchase
tickets.
• **Real-Time Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback to customers regarding the availability of
tickets and whether their purchase was successful.
• **Multithreading with pthread Library:** Demonstrate a basic use case of multithreading with
the pthread library in C, showcasing how multiple threads can access shared resources safely.
Overall, the code aims to illustrate a simplified model of a ticket booking system where
customers can purchase tickets for different movies while preventing conflicts and ensuring
thread safety in a multithreaded environment.
